# pu-cli Architecture

> "朴散则为器"——《老子》

## Overview

`Runtime` is the only object `main()` creates; everything else is injected into it
and holds no global state. A single session owns the conversation and is persisted
automatically, and the backend behind it can change without losing that state. The
components below carry the rest.

---

## Tech Stack

What each dependency is for:

- **Boost.Beast** — HTTP/WebSocket server (`pu serve`) and HTTP client
  (`BeastHttpClient`), built on top of **Boost.Asio**.
- **Boost.Asio** — asynchronous I/O core underneath Beast.
- **Boost.JSON** — JSON parsing/serialization (config, session persistence,
  WebSocket protocol, MCP, REST API).
- **Boost.ProgramOptions** — CLI option parsing.
- **OpenSSL** — TLS for `https://`/`wss://` connections in `BeastHttpClient`.
- **spdlog** — structured logging.

---

## Core Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `Runtime` | Plain object created by `main()`; owns `AgentManager`, `Toolbox`, `Executor`, `CommandRouter`; routes input, holds the single `Session`, rebuilds tool registry on agent switch |
| `Session` | Aggregate root: a `Conversation` + its `SessionSpec` |
| `Conversation` | The stored conversation: the `MessageGraph`, plus the `ChatMessage` view rendered from it |
| `Executor` | Session-state-free tool loop (holds config + probe cache); reads and writes the `Conversation`; injects system context and processes structured tool output |
| `LLMProvider` | Model gateway; handles transport + format adaptation. `StreamingProvider` implements the shared stream pipeline; a concrete backend fills in the endpoint, headers, and per-line parse |
| `Toolbox` | Tool registry with a fixed address; emptied and refilled per active agent, executes built-in and MCP tools |
| `CommandRouter` | Routes `/` commands to handlers |
| `Web Server` | `pu serve` (`RunServe`): Boost.Beast HTTP/WebSocket server exposing the session via `/ws` for chat and REST for control/status |
| `McpClient` | High-level MCP client: handshake, `ListTools`, `CallTool` |
| `mcp_session` | Free functions that connect a server set and disconnect it again — the whole connect/disconnect sequence, so `Runtime` holds the result rather than driving the loop |
| `JsonRpcClient` | JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol layer |
| `Transport` | Abstract MCP transport (`Start` / `Stop` / `WriteLine`) |
| `StdioTransport` | stdio subprocess transport |
| `HttpTransport` | remote streamable-HTTP transport (BeastHttpClient POST, line-delimited responses) |

---

## Error Handling

A condition the code can know in advance is checked, not thrown: an operation that can
fail visibly returns `std::optional` or `nullptr`. Exceptions are for what cannot be known
in advance — a body that does not parse, a peer that closes the socket, a provider that
answers with an error frame.

All non-recoverable runtime errors derive from one base class:

```
pu::RuntimeError : std::runtime_error
  ├── pu::RequestRefused        (the state cannot serve a well-formed request)
  └── pu::Error                 (the request or the configuration is wrong)
        └── pu::HttpError       (HttpClient failures)
```

`pu::RequestRefused` sits beside `Error` rather than under it: `pu serve` answers a refusal
with `400` and an `Error` with `500`, so deriving one from the other would report a
caller's mistake as a fault of this process. The status a route chooses, and the body that
carries it, are in [README](../README.md#web-api).

A catch earns its place only by changing the control flow — returning a value, retrying,
falling back, converting, or ending the process. Logging is not handling, and a catch
whose whole body logs before the path carries on as if nothing happened is the shape to
avoid. The three boundaries where reporting and continuing coexist:

| Boundary | Why a catch is there | What it carries |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| A call site that parses | `json::parse` throwing is how a byte string says it is not JSON | the value the caller wants: a default, a fallback, a marked-invalid record |
| A background thread (`McpClient`, the WebSocket reader) | no caller exists above it to be told | the log is the report; the promise or socket carries the outcome |
| The process boundary (`main`, CLI entry points) | returning is no longer an option | the message is the entire response |

A failure that cannot be converted is raised, not answered with a plausible-looking empty
value: a `tools/list` that fails is not a server with no tools, so `McpClient::ListTools`
throws and `Runtime::RebuildToolbox` skips that server the way it skips one that never
connected.

An absent `agents.json` is an ordinary state, not a failure: `config::FindConfigPath`
returns an empty string and `FindServeOptions` returns `std::nullopt`. Only
`Runtime::Initialize`, which cannot continue, turns the empty path into the `Error` naming
where the file goes. A function reports that it cannot answer rather than picking one
caller's condition to raise.

The same holds for invariants: `Runtime::ActiveAgent` and `ConfiguredBackend` do not check
that `Initialize` ran, because every path reaching them passes through it. A test for a
condition that cannot be false asserts that the code distrusts itself.

---

## JSON Handling

All JSON parsing and serialization is provided by **Boost.JSON**
(`boost::json::value`). `include/pu/core/json.hpp` is a thin convenience layer over
it: `parse`, `serialize`, `ValueOrDefault`, `HasKey` and `PrettyPrint`. Each one
carries its own contract where it is declared, and the helper is what to reach for
rather than the raw Boost call, so the fallbacks stay in one place.

JSON is used for configuration (`agents.json`), session persistence
(`Session::Serialize` / `Session::Deserialize`), structured tool output
(`pu::tools::tool.hpp`), the MCP JSON-RPC layer, and the WebSocket/REST
API in `src/app/serve_http_routes.cpp` and `src/app/serve.cpp`.

---

## Executor

The tool loop holds no session state (`main()` injects its collaborators) and
runs once per turn: read the `Conversation`, inject system context, call the
provider, execute any tool calls through `Toolbox`, store each structured result
verbatim, and repeat until the reply carries no call.

**System context.** `Executor` prepends a system message built from:

- OS name and kernel version (probed once, see below)
- Security policy (sandbox root, forbidden patterns)
- Current working directory (the sandbox root)
- Tool-use guidelines for the model

It is merged with the agent's configured `system_prompt`, which comes from
`agents.json` via `Runtime::RebuildToolbox` and is not session state, so
switching the backend does not clear it.

**Structured tool output.** Tools return JSON through the schema in
`include/pu/tools/tool.hpp`, whose field set is documented in
[README](../README.md#tool-output-format). The executor stores it verbatim so
the model sees what the tool produced, and reads `output`/`error` out of it only
for the tool callbacks. `Toolbox::ExecuteTool` answers with the same envelope
when the named tool is absent, so callers never parse two shapes.

**Environment probing.** `Executor::ProbeStaticEnvironment()` runs once during
construction (`uname` on POSIX, the Windows kernel API elsewhere) and caches the
result. No tool-binary detection is performed.

**Forbidden patterns.** `forbidden_patterns` is enforced at the tool execution
layer: a matching command is rejected with a JSON error. The policy fields live in
[README](../README.md#agentsjson).

---

## Runtime Lifecycle & Dependency Injection

`Runtime` is not a singleton. `main()` constructs a single instance and owns every
major collaborator as a `unique_ptr` member:

```
main()
 ├─ pu::Runtime runtime;
 ├─ RunAsk / RunChat(runtime)
 └─ catch (std::exception&) → friendly message
```

Key responsibilities:

- `Initialize(config_path)` — loads `agents.json` (from `./.pu/` or `~/.pu/`), creates `AgentManager`, `Executor`, `CommandRouter`, builds the default toolbox, then restores the single session from `<workspace>/.pu/session.json` if present.
- `ProcessInput(input, ...)` — routes either to `CommandRouter` (commands) or to `Executor` (messages), then saves the session.
- `Shutdown()` — saves the single session to `<workspace>/.pu/session.json`.
- `SwitchAgent(agent)` — updates the active agent and rebuilds the toolbox.

### Web server lifecycle

`pu serve` runs the same `Runtime` instance behind a Boost.Beast front-end
(`RunServe` in `src/app/serve.cpp`), on the host and port that the command line, the
environment, or the workspace's own `serve` block names:

1. `Runtime::Initialize()` loads `agents.json` and restores the session, then the
   server mounts the static `web/` UI and registers the HTTP routes.
2. An Asio `io_context` drives the `tcp::acceptor` on its own thread, with
   `reuse_address` set before the bind so a restart can take a port a just-closed
   server left connections in `TIME_WAIT` on.
3. Each accepted connection is dispatched on a strand of its own. A plain HTTP request
   is read and dispatched to the static/REST routes on that strand — a short request
   and response, so its I/O stays synchronous and the connection ends with it. A
   WebSocket upgrade on `/ws` is handed to a `WebSocketConnection`, whose I/O is
   asynchronous from there on.
4. A second upgrade while a page is attached is answered with a `busy` frame and
   closed: one session, one page. Claiming the session happens when the upgrade is
   accepted, not when the first run arrives, so the refusal reaches the peer before its
   socket goes.
5. A run is queued to a single `SessionRunner` worker, which runs `ProcessInput` and
   posts each frame back through the connection. The runner holds only the tokens that
   steer the turn; the worker reads them by value, so a `cancel` or `stop_command` on
   the strand reaches a turn in flight without waiting for it. The message schema, the
   REST route table, and the status each refusal carries are in
   [README](../README.md#web-api).
6. On Ctrl+C the acceptor is closed, the `io_context` is stopped — which aborts every
   pending read and write, so no connection thread is left blocked — the runner is
   stopped, and `Runtime::Shutdown()` persists the session.

### Single-session auto-persistence

`Runtime` maintains a single `std::shared_ptr<Session> current_session_`. On
`Initialize()` it loads `<workspace>/.pu/session.json` (if the file exists) via
`Session::Deserialize`. After every `ProcessInput()` call and on `Shutdown()`, the
session is serialized back to the same file via `Session::Serialize`. There is no
manual save/load/list/export; persistence is fully automatic and scoped to the
data directory.

### Toolbox & MCP lifecycle

 ```
 RebuildToolbox(agent)
   ├─ DisconnectMcpServers(mcp_clients_)
   ├─ ConnectMcpServers(agent.mcp_servers) // one client per server that answered
   ├─ toolbox_.Clear()
   ├─ RegisterBuiltinTools()
   ├─ RegisterMcpTools()                   // ListTools() → register mcp.<server>.<tool>
   └─ executor_->SetSecurityPolicy(agent.security)
  ```

 `Runtime` still owns the connected `mcp_clients_`, but the connect/disconnect
 sequencing itself lives in `pu::mcp` as three free functions
 (`ConnectMcpServer`, `ConnectMcpServers`, `DisconnectMcpServers`); `Runtime`
 holds the result rather than driving the loop. Because a client remembers the
 server it was built from (`McpClient::ServerName()`), registration pairs tools
 with their server without reaching back into the vector for the last element
 pushed.

 `Toolbox` is a value member of `Runtime` and `RebuildToolbox` empties it in place rather
 than replacing it, so the registry keeps one address for the process lifetime. The
 executor still receives it by reference per `Execute` call, but the reason is ordinary
 parameter passing rather than self-defence: there is no second address to be left
 pointing at, and no uninitialized state to guard against.

 `Toolbox::RegisterTool` returns `false` instead of throwing when a name is empty or the
 tool is null. Both conditions are knowable at the call site, so the caller decides —
 `RegisterBuiltinTools` names its tools statically and ignores the result, while the MCP
 loop warns and skips the one tool whose sanitized name was rejected.

 An `McpTool` holds its client through a `shared_ptr`, so a rebuild dropping the runtime's
 reference does not pull the client out from under a tool that still refers to it. That is
 what makes the order of the first two steps above a matter of tidiness rather than
 correctness: whichever runs first, no tool outlives the connection it calls through.

---

## Streaming & Cancellation

### Cancel token

A `CancelToken` threads through the request stack from `Runtime::ProcessInput`
down to the HTTP stream; the provider polls it between chunks and the transport
between reads of the body, so a cancellation surfaces quickly even from a stream
that has gone quiet. In `pu serve` it is set by a `cancel` message or by the client
watching the turn going away, so closing the page stops the reply as surely as the
Stop button does. The turn then ends with neither a reply nor an error.

### HTTP streaming

A provider's answer arrives as an SSE body the producer writes over the life of the
request, and `BeastHttpClient::StreamResponse` reads it the way it is written: the
header first, then the body in bounded pieces, each handed to the line parser as it
lands. Reading the body to its end before parsing any of it collapses the stream into
one delivery at the end, and every layer above is then streaming in name only — a
page cannot show a reply growing, and a stop has nothing left to interrupt. The
failure path is the exception: an error body is collected whole, because the message
that says what went wrong is in it.

### WebSocket streaming

Chat runs exclusively over the `/ws` WebSocket. A run message is queued to the
`SessionRunner`, whose single worker starts `ProcessInput`; its `content_callback`
hands each streamed chunk back through the connection, which queues it and writes it on
the connection's strand, producing the typewriter effect in the browser. The
`ToolCallbacks` passed alongside it emit tool start/end events keyed by the tool call
`id`. Commands and non-streaming backends deliver their full text as a single chunk
frame. The frame schema is owned by [README](../README.md#web-api) and implemented in
`web/app.js`.

The read loop is what an asynchronous stream buys: a connection parked in a synchronous
read cannot be woken by closing its socket, so a shutdown would wait on a client that
will never speak again. Here the run happens on the runner's own thread and the stream
belongs to the strand, so shutdown stops the `io_context` and every read returns at once.

A turn belongs to the client watching it. Closing the page, losing the socket, or a
second client taking over all end it, and nothing of it is kept: what it had written
is half an answer, and storing that would make the next request read it as the model's
finished reply. The chat is therefore never driven by nobody, and a page that reloads
mid-answer comes back to the conversation as the store has it — the question, and no
reply to it.

## Provider Differences

What each backend puts on the wire is reference material, not architecture, and
lives in [providers.md](providers.md).

## Data Flow

```

    │

                         │

                       Executor.Execute()          (session-state-free)
                         │
                         ├── Inject system context into chat history
                         ├── Read the Conversation
                         ├── LLMProvider.Chat()
                         ├── Toolbox.ExecuteTool() → JSON response
                         ├── Store the tool result in the Conversation
                         ├── Repeat tool loop if tool calls present
                         └── Return final response
                         │
                         ▼
                       Session::Serialize() → session.json
```

Each stored node is rendered into one `ChatMessage` on the way out
(`include/pu/session/request.hpp`), which is the view a provider requires. That makes
`ChatMessage` a compatibility view rather than a place to grow: a new context
feature belongs to `MessageNode` (`include/pu/context/message.hpp`), which owns what
a turn is.

```

MCP servers are configured per-agent via `mcp_servers`, and a list may hold any
number of them: each is started as its own client, and its tools are registered
under the `mcp.<server>.` prefix. The transport is selected automatically in
`McpClient::Connect()`: a non-empty `url` selects the remote `HttpTransport`,
otherwise the stdio subprocess transport is spawned. Stdio runs a child process
on both POSIX (`fork`/`execvp`) and Windows (`CreateProcess`), and HTTP goes
through `BeastHttpClient`, so both work on every platform. When an agent becomes
active, `Runtime::RebuildToolbox` starts its servers, performs the handshake, and
lists tools.

---

## Persistence

```
<workspace>/.pu/session.json   # Single session state
./.pu/logs/                    # Log output, moved by PU_HOME
```

`<workspace>` is the directory `pu` was started in. Logs are the only thing
`PU_HOME` moves; the environment table in [README](../README.md#environment-variables)
owns both paths.

The session file carries `schema_version` beside `conversation` and
`session_spec`. It is written automatically after every interaction and on
shutdown, and restored on startup. A file stamped with a version this build does
not accept is refused rather than read best-effort.

`session_spec` names the agent and carries the session's own thinking level when
`/thinking` set one. Backend fields are read from `agents.json` on each start, so
editing the configuration takes effect without touching the session.
`/backend <type> <model>` adopts an agent named after the type, so the backend a
session reports and the agent it names are always the same answer. The session
also decides which agent a restart resumes: the named agent wins over
`default_agent`.

The conversation is a chain: `conversation.history` holds `nodes`, each with its id,
timestamp, its parent and one role payload, plus the `leaf` that marks the current
position. A payload's `content` is a single string, and reasoning is a list of blocks,
each with the provider's `text`, an optional `signature` and the provider's own `raw`
encoding when it round-trips (see [providers.md](./providers.md)).

A node's id is its own, not a position: the earlier `id = size() + 1` scheme made a
rewind representable only by rewriting the file, and a branch not at all.

`/rewind` moves the `leaf` back and removes nothing, so the turns after it stay
in the file until something replaces them. The append that follows drops whatever
the new leaf cannot reach, so a replaced turn leaves nothing behind and the store
ends up holding exactly the chain the view shows.

A file without the version, with another one, or whose history is not node storage is
refused rather than guessed at: `pu` reports the reason and starts a fresh
conversation, and the next save replaces the file.

The session file contains no system prompt: the prompt is configuration and is
read from `agents.json` on every start.

---

## Directory Structure

The tree is layered bottom-up: `core/` holds dependency-free base utilities,
the domain modules sit beside it, and the orchestration headers/modules live at
the root of `include/pu/` and `src/`.

```
include/pu/                  src/
├── agent_manager.hpp        ├── app/                  # main, CLI parsing, serve
├── command_router.hpp       ├── config/               # agents.json, the backend model
├── runtime.hpp              ├── runtime.cpp, command_router.cpp
├── executor.hpp             ├── executor.cpp
├── app/                     ├── core/                 # logging, platform, HTTP client
├── config/                  ├── context/              # message graph storage
├── core/                    ├── gateways/            # one file per gate, behind a table
├── context/                 ├── llm/                  # protocols, providers, streaming parser
├── llm/                     ├── mcp/                  # transports, JSON-RPC client
├── mcp/                     ├── session/              # Session, Conversation
├── session/                 └── tools/                # Toolbox, tools
└── tools/
```

A header lives in `include/pu/` when code outside its own directory uses it
(including tests); otherwise it stays next to its `.cpp`. A header whose module
has a directory belongs in that directory, so `app/cli.hpp` sits beside
`src/app/cli.cpp`.

The CMake targets follow the layering: `pu_lib` is the *base* static library
(core + domain modules), `pu_agent` holds the orchestration layer, `pu_app`
holds `src/app/`, and the `pu` executable adds only `main.cpp`.

### Gates, protocols and providers

Three facts about a vendor that look alike are three different things: a **protocol** is
*how to talk*, a **gate** is *which product*, and a connection is *where*. `config/gateway.hpp`
holds the middle one: `GatewayId` names the gates a build carries, `Gateway` is
`{id, name, default_host, make_provider, make_listing}`, and `Gateways()` / `FindGateway()`
/ `GatewayForId()` answer from one explicit table in `src/gateways/registry.cpp`. Each gate
is a file beside it, stating its own name, host, provider and catalogue read; adding one is
that file and one line of the table, and there is no registry the linker can drop.

`agents.json` names a gate through `gateway`, and a missing or unknown name is refused rather
than defaulted, so a backend never reaches a host its author did not choose. The field is what
a stored config carries; `BackendTypeName()` / `ParseBackendType()` are gone, and one parser
resolves the name.

A protocol stays what it was — the implementation of how a gate talks. `openai` is split into
`llm/openai_protocol.{hpp,cpp}` (the wire format) and `OpenAIProvider` (that protocol at one
host with one set of headers), because a change to the SSE parse and a change to a gate's
headers are different changes; `ollama` keeps protocol and provider in one class. The gate
abstraction stops short of one thing the design chose not to build yet: a gate offering more
than one protocol, which would need an `entry` between the gate and the protocol. Every gate
measured so far speaks exactly one, so that layer is deferred rather than carried as unused
state — see [design/gateway-protocol-layout.md](design/gateway-protocol-layout.md).

### Dependency direction

Includes point one way: `core/` is a leaf, `config/` and `llm/` build on it, and
`mcp/`, `tools/`, `session/`, and the orchestration headers build on those. No
directory includes a peer that sits above it, and `config/` in particular never
reaches `mcp/`.

The rule holds because a record belongs to the layer that *parses* it, not the
layer that *uses* it. `config/mcp_server.hpp` and `config/security_policy.hpp`
are leaf headers holding plain data — `McpServerConfig` (read from `agents.json`)
and `SecurityPolicy` — so `mcp/client.hpp` and `tools/tool.hpp` include them
rather than the reverse. Before the split both were declared next to their
consumers, which made `tools/` depend on `config/` depending on `mcp/`: a cycle
that pulled the whole transport layer into any header naming a `Tool`.

---

## Extension Points

- **New gate**: Add `src/gateways/<name>.cpp`, stating the name, the default host, how to build the gate's provider, and how to build its catalogue read; then name it in the table in `src/gateways/registry.cpp`. A gate that speaks an existing protocol reuses its provider and inherits `StreamingProvider`; one that does not supplies its own. Removing a gate is the same in reverse - the file and its line.
- **New tool**: Inherit `pu::Tool`, implement methods, register in `Runtime::RegisterBuiltinTools()`.
- **New command**: Add handler in `CommandRouter`, route, update help.
- **External tool (no C++)**: Add an `mcp_servers` entry to `agents.json` — tools are discovered automatically when the agent becomes active.

---

## Known Limitations

- MCP requests time out after a fixed 5 seconds.
- Environment probing can come up empty: an absent `uname` on POSIX yields nothing, and a failed Windows kernel API falls back to `"unknown"`.
- **Nothing enforces a token budget, by design.** `ChatResult::usage` carries what the provider counted, and the executor logs it at `debug`, but no limit is compared against it, so a conversation still grows until the provider refuses it and the refusal reaches the user as an HTTP error.
- **A `max_tokens` cap that lands inside a tool call ends the turn with an error.** The reply stops mid-argument, so the call never completed and its text is not a usable argument; the provider raises rather than keeping the fragment. A `finish_reason` other than `length` leaves a non-JSON argument as it stands.
- **A cancelled run keeps no partial reply, by design.** The transport aborts the stream and the executor ends the turn with neither a reply nor an error, so nothing is appended: the session holds the user message and no answer, and a follow-up "continue" restarts the answer rather than resuming it.
- **The store is only persisted after a completed interaction and on shutdown.** A crash loses everything since the last save, and the store is held in memory in between.
